# TODO List for Simple RAG Implementation with Ollama

- [x] Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies (streamlit, langchain, chromadb, pypdf2, ollama)
- [ ] Rewrite main.py as Streamlit app for document upload and Q&A
- [ ] Implement document processing: text extraction, chunking, embedding
- [ ] Set up ChromaDB for vector storage
- [ ] Implement retrieval and context injection for Ollama
- [ ] Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Test the RAG system with sample documents
- [ ] Ensure Ollama is running locally for embeddings and LLM
